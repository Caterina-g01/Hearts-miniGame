Heart Transfer Game

This is a simple and fun game I created, where the goal is to transfer 100 red hearts into white hearts in just 15 seconds. The game tests your speed and accuracy as you click to move the hearts.

How to Play:
There are two columns of hearts: Red Hearts and White Hearts.
You start with 100 red hearts and no white hearts.
The goal is to click on the + button next to the white hearts to move red hearts into the white column.
You can also remove hearts from the columns using the - button, but keep in mind that removing a white heart will add a red heart back to the red column.
The game ends once you manage to move all 100 red hearts into the white hearts column within 15 seconds.
Features:
Timer: The game lasts for 15 seconds. A countdown shows how much time you have left.
Red Hearts Counter: Keep track of the number of red hearts you have.
White Hearts Counter: Keep track of the number of white hearts you have.
Win/Lose Condition: If you manage to move all the hearts before time runs out, you win the game! If not, you lose and can try again.
How to Start:
Click the "Start the Game" button to begin.
The game will first show the rules, and once the countdown finishes, the game will start automatically.
Try to move all the hearts as quickly and accurately as possible!
